Name:
	clic (cloud-init-compile) â€” compile multiple scripts into a single script.

Author:
	${constants.package.author}

Usage:
	clic (-r FPATH | --run FPATH) [--] <fpath>...
	clic (-r FPATH | --run FPATH) (-z|--gzip) [${ encodings.join('|') }] [--] <fpath>...
	clic (-h | --help | --version)

Description:

	clic bundles multiple scripts into a single Bash script that can be executed by Cloud-Init. It:

	* Embeds each file into the script as a here-document.
	* Writes each file to its filename on the target machine.
	* Executes a single supplied filename, adding executable permissions if required.

Notes:

	* All files are assumed to be UTF-8 encoded.
	* The highest level of compression is used when gzip is enabled.

Options:
	-r FPATH, --run FPATH    The path or basename of the script to execute. This script must be
	                         included as a path argument too (see below).
	-z, --gzip               Gzip-compress the cloud-init script. This is helpful, as
	                         Cloud-Init scripts are generally limited to 16kb.  If gzip is enabled, you may specify one of the
	                         following encodings for the output text. By default, ${constants.defaults.encoding} is used:

encodingOptions.join('\n') +

`
	-h, --help               Display this documentation.

Arguments:
	<fpath>...               The relative file paths to load content from. If a file fails to load, an error is shown but an
	                         output script will be generated from the remaining files.

Version:
	v${constants.package.version}
