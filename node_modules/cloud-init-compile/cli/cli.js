Name:
	clic (cloud-init-compile) â€” compile multiple scripts into a single script.

Usage:
	clic (-r FPATH | --run FPATH) [-z|--gzip] [--] <fpath>...
	clic (-h | --help | --version)

Description:

	clic bundles multiple scripts into a single Bash script that can be executed by
	Cloud-Init. It:

	* Embeds each file into the script as a here-document.
	* Writes each file to its filename on the target machine.
	* Executes a single supplied filename, adding executable permissions if required.

Notes:

	* All files are assumed to be UTF-8 encoded.
	* The highest level of compression is used when gzip is enabled.

Options:
	-z, --gzip               Gzip-compress the cloud-init script. This is helpful, as
	                         Cloud-Init scripts are generally limited to 16kb.
	-r FPATH, --run FPATH    The path or basename of the script to execute. This script must be
	                         included as a path argument too (see below).
	-h, --help               Display this documentation.

Arguments:
	<fpath>...      The relative file paths to load content from.
